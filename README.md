Code for Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This code demonstrates how to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict churn using customer data. The code uses the TensorFlow library for creating and training the ANN model.

Dependencies
The code requires the following libraries to be installed:

numpy (imported as np)
pandas (imported as pd)
tensorflow (imported as tf)
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using the pip package manager.

Usage
Import the required libraries:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf

Check the TensorFlow version:
python
Copy code
print("Tensorflow version: " + tf.__version__)
Data Preprocessing:


Note: Make sure to provide the correct file path for the dataset in the pd.read_csv() function.

Feel free to modify the code according to your specific requirements and dataset.
